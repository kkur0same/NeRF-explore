This best practice assumes you have instant-ngp windows version download.

1) cd to the directory that contains instant-ngp.exe.
2) download opencv 
-> C:\Users\anaconda3\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
-> pip install opencv-python
3) Dataset preparation:
    For video: basic idea is to use ffmpeg to take frames from the video.
    cd to video data directory
    run the following command: 
    -> python "C:\Users\Documents\instant-ngp\scripts\colmap2nerf.py" --video_in <path of the video> --video_fps <fps> --run_colmap --aabb_scale 16 --overwrite
    note: --overwrite means it will automatically proceed overwriting without asking you.
          --fps if you have have 6 sec video, and if fps is 2, it will produce 12 images. It is recommended to choose a frame rate that leads to around 50-150 images.
          best is to create a folder for your input video path, so that the generated images will be in the same folder with your video.
          extracted images and transform.json must be in the same folder.
4) at instant-ngp directory command prompt, run instant-ngp <path to nerf_data_folder_name>, or open the instant-ngp.exe and drag the nerf data folder to it.
5) Reduce Polygon:
    download instant mesh (https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes) to reduce polygon of your model.
